# Photogrammetric Computer Vision Online excercises


## Notice
These are the exercises that we arranged for the online course
"Photogrammetric Computer Vision". The individual exercises stem 
from related courses taught at the University of Bonn. Thus, the 
numbering of the exercises within the notebook files are not 
consistent; but in this way, files are identical for identical 
exercises.

The intention of sharing the exercises is to allow students to 
study and practice on their own and get a deeper understanding 
of the topic. 

For the exercises, you need to use Python and Jupyter notebooks.
Please note that we cannot provide any support for the exercises.

# About the Photogrammetry

## What is Photogrammetry ?
* Is the task of measuring with light or measuring with photographs of photos: "photos" = light, "gramma": to drawn, "metron": to measure.
* Measurement: what does the environment looks like 
* More than just the visible spectrum (pixel intensity), this can be extended with electromagnetic...

In conclusion: "Estimation of the geometric (shape, position, ...) and semantic (meaning, ...) properties of objects based on images or observations from similar sensors
(cameras, laser scanner, ...)".

## What do we Measure ? 
* Camera localization
* Location of objects 
* 3D reconstruction
* Similarities and data association 
* Object detection 
* Semantic interpretation
* ...

## Involved Fields
* Traditional photogrammetry
* Computer vision 
* Machine learning 
* Robotics


## Two key problems in Photogrammetry
* Estimating semantic 
* Estimating geometry

## Application 
* Maps
* Terrain Models
* Environment Monitoring 
* Orthophotos 
* 3D City Models 
* Digital Preservation of Cultural Heritage
* Robotics
* Visual Localization (Answer the question: Is it the same place ?)
* Robotic Cars
* ....
